# Music-Improvisation-using-LSTM
## 1 - Problem statement

You would like to create a jazz music piece specially for a friend's birthday. However, you don't know any instruments or music composition. Fortunately, you know deep learning and will solve this problem using an LSTM network.  

You will train a network to generate novel jazz solos in a style representative of a body of performed work.

Details about music (optional)
You can informally think of each "value" as a note, which comprises a pitch and duration. For example, if you press down a specific piano key for 0.5 seconds, then you have just played a note. In music theory, a "value" is actually more complicated than this--specifically, it also captures the information needed to play multiple notes at the same time. For example, when playing a music piece, you might press down two piano keys at the same time (playing multiple notes at the same time generates what's called a "chord"). But we don't need to worry about the details of music theory for this assignment.
